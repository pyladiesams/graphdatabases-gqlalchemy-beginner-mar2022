### Level: Beginner 
### Presentation: [An Introduction to Graph Databases with GQLAlchemy and Python](workshop/an-introduction-to-graph-databases-with-gqlalchemy-and-python.pdf)

## Workshop description
Through this tutorial, you will learn how to create a graph model from a dataset, run Memgraph with Docker, connect to it from a Jupyter Notebook with the help of GQLAlchemy, and perform simple queries.
